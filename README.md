## Installing

[Download the source](https://github.com/moov2/Moov2.OrchardCore.Gallery/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine. Add the project to your solution that contains an Orchard Core project and add a reference to Moov2.OrchardCore.Gallery. When running the Orchard Core project the module will be available to enable, which will expose a `GalleryPart` that can be attached to a content type.

Once the module is in a usable state we'll make it available via NuGet.
